# videogame
Used Jupyter Notebooks to load JSON
data from CORGIS Collection dataset. In the notebook, I analyzed data about various video
game categories such as review scores, price of the video game, time needed to play, etc. I
used the matplotlib library to make graphs so that it would be easier to visualize the data.
